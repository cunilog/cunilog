/*
	This is a simple module/unit that provides UTF-8 versions of some common Windows API
	calls.

	If you need a fully-fledged UTF-8 wrapper library for the Windows API, there's a neat
	library on Github (https://github.com/thpatch/win32_utf8) that may be better suitable
	than this module/unit. Due to its design, the win32_utf8 library is more flexible and
	much more complete but also slower. The main difference is that win32_utf8 always
	allocates buffers on the heap while this module here attempts to use stack-based buffers
	if possible.

	The purpose of this module here is to keep it small, simple, and fast. Only a small
	subset of the Windows API is supported. None of the Window system (GUI) functions are
	implemented.
	
	Most functions that work with files and/or folders exist in two versions: One for
	standard paths that allow for relative paths and paths that include path navigators
	("..\.."). These functions end in U8, as for instance in MoveFileU8 (). The other
	type of file and/or folder functions end in U8long, like for instance in
	MoveFileU8long (). These functions implicitely prepend path and filename parameters
	with a long filename prefix ("\\?\") but do not support relative paths or paths that
	contain navigators. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file
	for details.

	reqUTF8sizeFromUTF16wchars
	
	Computes the maximum size, in octets (bytes), required by the UTF-8
	representation of a UTF-16 string with the amount of w UTF-16 characters.
	This macro can be used for buffer allocations.
	
	See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Unicode_encodings for more
	information.
	
	Excerpt:
	"UTF-8 requires 8, 16, 24 or 32 bits (one to four bytes) to encode a Unicode character,
	UTF-16 requires either 16 or 32 bits to encode a character, and UTF-32 always requires
	32 bits to encode a character. The first 128 Unicode code points, U+0000 to U+007F, used
	for the C0 Controls and Basic Latin characters and which correspond one-to-one to their
	ASCII-code equivalents, are encoded using 8 bits in UTF-8, 16 bits in UTF-16, and 32 bits
	in UTF-32.
	The next 1,920 characters, U+0080 to U+07FF (encompassing the remainder of almost all
	Latin-script alphabets, and also Greek, Cyrillic, Coptic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac,
	Tāna and N'Ko), require 16 bits to encode in both UTF-8 and UTF-16, and 32 bits in UTF-32.
	For U+0800 to U+FFFF, i.e. the remainder of the characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane
	(BMP, plane 0, U+0000 to U+FFFF), which encompasses the rest of the characters of most of
	the world's living languages, UTF-8 needs 24 bits to encode a character, while UTF-16
	needs 16 bits and UTF-32 needs 32. Code points U+010000 to U+10FFFF, which represent
	characters in the supplementary planes (planes 1–16), require 32 bits in UTF-8, UTF-16
	and UTF-32."
	
	In other words, UTF-8 can require up to 1.5 * the size of UTF-16.
	
	Since this macro expects the amount of UTF-16 characters as its parameter, which is 2
	octets per character, it returns 2 * w + w.
