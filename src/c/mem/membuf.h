/*
	setToSizeSMEMBUF

	Sets the size of the buffer of the SMEMBUF structure pb points to to exactly size siz,
	if it is not identical to size yet by calling ubf_realloc () or ubf_free () and
	ubf_malloc () on it. If the new size is smaller then the current one, ubf_realloc () is
	called to resize the buffer. In this case there's a good chance the current content of
	the buffer is preserved unless ubf_realloc () fails. When the parameter size is greater
	than the current size of the buffer, the function calls ubf_free () and ubf_malloc () to
	accommodate for the new size. The current content of the buffer is lost in this case.

	Note that this function reallocates or frees and newly allocates the buffer size every time
	the parameter siz is not exactly the size of the existing buffer, even if size is smaller
	and a reallocation would actually not be required to hold the intended data. Consider
	calling growToSizeSMEMBUF () instead, which only reallocates when the buffer is too small.
	
	The function returns a pointer to ps->buf.pvoid.
	
	If the function fails it calls doneSMEMBUF () on the structure to free its memory block and
	make it unusable. Check with isUsableSMEMBUF() if the structure can be used afterwards.
	Note that the functions returning a value unequal to NULL alone is not a reliable way of
	determining that the function succeeded.

	least siz the function does not change the buffer. In other words the buffer can only
	grow but never shrinks, which is what you most likely want.

	lost.
