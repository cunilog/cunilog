2014-03-10	Thomas			This history added.
2016-12-09	Thomas			Definitions for TRUE and FALSE removed.
2019-10-13	Thomas			Include files moved to the header.
2024-05-21	Thomas			Function memstrrchr () fixed.

	The original version of memstrstr () has been taken from
	http://www.koders.com/c/fid2330745E0E8C0A0F5E2CF94799642712318471D0.aspx?s=getopt#L459
	which is buggy and doesn't work under certain circumstances.

	Function:	memstrstr

	The function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of s2 in s1.
	If s2 cannot be found in s1 the return value is NULL. If size2 is
	0 the function returns s1.

	The function memstrstr is basically a replacement for strstr
	(http://www.cppreference.com/stdstring/strstr.html) but does not require
	NULL terminated strings. It can handle any buffer which can contain any
	byte sequence including NUL characters.

	The original version of this function has been taken from
	http://www.koders.com/c/fid2330745E0E8C0A0F5E2CF94799642712318471D0.aspx?s=getopt#L459
	which needed fixing first. The page has disappeared in the meantime (2018). The
	Wayback Machine also holds no copy of it.

	Like memstrstr but only returns the nth occurrance of s2 in s1 if
	s2 has been found amount times in s1. Returns NULL if s1 does not
	contain s2 amount times.

	Example:
	s1: "This is a test for memstrstrn."
	s2: "e"
	amount: 2 (second occurrance of s2 in s1)
	Returns "emstrstrn."
