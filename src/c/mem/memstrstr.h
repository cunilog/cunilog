	memstrstr

	The function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of s2 in s1.
	If s2 cannot be found in s1 the return value is NULL. If size2 is
	0 the function returns s1.

	The function memstrstr is basically a replacement for strstr
	(http://www.cppreference.com/stdstring/strstr.html) but does not require
	NULL terminated strings. It can handle any buffer which can contain any
	byte sequence including NULL characters.

	The original version of this function has been taken from
	http://www.koders.com/c/fid2330745E0E8C0A0F5E2CF94799642712318471D0.aspx?s=getopt#L459
	which needed fixing first. The page has disappeared in the meantime (2018). The
	Wayback Machine also holds no copy of it.

	For Linux systems, this function could be replaced by memmem (). See
	https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memmem.3.html .

	memstrstrn

	Like memstrstr but only returns the nth occurrance of s2 in s1 if
	s2 has been found amount times in s1. Returns NULL if s1 does not

	s1: "This is a test for memstrstrn."
	s2: "e"
	amount: 2 (second occurrance of s2 in s1)
	memstrstrn (s1, strlen (s1), s2, strlen (s2), 2);
